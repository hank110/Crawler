Weibo Content Crawler 

2015/Jan/15  
- Added wait functionalities for the code to wait until a browser is fully loaded  
- ID of those who posted the feeds now can be crawled


2015/Jan/16
- Number of likes, retweets, comments for each post can be crawled now  
- Time that each post got uploaded can now be crawled
(Needs additional work on crawling time for those referred tweets within the crawled tweet itself)  
- Or is it really necessary to crawl the referred tweets?
